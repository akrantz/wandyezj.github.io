A Marketing email from 2019

```text
Welcome to the Soylent Community! I’m delighted you’re here.

People often ask me if Soylent is trying to eliminate food. The answer is no — we love food! What we want to eliminate are the times when you need food as fuel, and you either skip a meal or make an unhealthy, unsustainable, or expensive choice. We call those times “food voids” and we’re on a mission to make them obsolete with a more nutritious, sustainable, and affordable choice.

There’s no limit to innovation here at Soylent. We’re continually researching and developing new products, iterating and improving our current lineup, and working toward a better future for everyone. Your support is an integral part of our journey and we welcome any feedback you may have!

Thank you again. Feel free to reply to this email if you have any questions, comments, or want to say hello!

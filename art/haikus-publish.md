# Haikus Publish

Many thanks to the individuals who inspired me.



curb waste and conserve
use less for a big impact
keep recycling

Software Engineer
starting a second career
haikus everywhere

Sitting on the bus
so much time to write haikus
hope you like this one

I write poetry
freeing my mind to explore
coalescing thoughts

wonderful teachers
bestowed great wisdom on me
my mind is now free

a haikus constraints
challenging complexity
yet simplicity

Read philosophy
discover complexity
think critically

Everyone's unique
yet experience shows us
we are all the same

Haiku's discipline
encourages concision;
each syllable counts.

Avoid anarchy;
rules are a necessity
to prevent chaos

Haiku's simple rule
is easily learned at school
knowing makes you cool

five in the first line
seven in the middle line
five in the last line

Of all the ponies,
Twilight Sparkle is the best;
friendship is magic.

eschew bland labels
you're an individual
live outside a box

Artistic desire
to express and inspire
finally unleashed

excellent teachers
are questioners, not preachers;
make Socrates proud

Program Managers
People Manipulators
Productive Masters

Two sides of a coin
appear completely distinct
a glimpse of the whole

Too many Haiku's?
Impossible, I declare!
Spread them everywhere!

guiding our actions,
reflecting our souls passions,
poetry ignites

# Deming Fourteen Key Principles Applied To Software

[Deming's Key Principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Edwards_Deming#Key_principles) were designed for manufacturing and automotive industry and mass manufacturing.

It's important to understand the differences between management in mass manufacturing and software before applying these principles.

Deming's primary focus is on the abstract idea of 'Quality' which is defined as improving peoples standard of living. For Deming only by improved quality can productivity and 

Automotive and Software have similar supply chains. With massive chains of dependencies that culminate in a final product. A final automotive assembly plant puts together components such as a vehicles body, engine, wiring harness, interior, etc.. Similarly software combined multiple component libraries to form a final product.

Deming's key insight it to look at the entire system of manufacturing and to distill insights on how to improve the quality of the system in order to produce higher quality products. With a key focus on people and their relationships to each other.

How many engineers take a class on quality?



## Fourteen Key Principles

### 1 Create constancy of purpose toward improvement of product and service, with the aim to become competitive, to stay in business and to provide jobs.

We want to be able to constantly improve software

### 2 Adopt the new philosophy. We are in a new economic age. Western management must awaken to the challenge, must learn their responsibilities, and take on leadership for change.

Management is responsible for leading change.

### 3 Cease dependence on inspection to achieve quality. Eliminate the need for massive inspection by building quality into the product in the first place.

Can not depend on manual code reviews or manual testing.

"someone should have caught it in a code review" is not a valid response.

The process used to build software must enforce and produce quality at all times.

### 4 End the practice of awarding business on the basis of a price tag. Instead, minimize total cost. Move towards a single supplier for any one item, on a long-term relationship of loyalty and trust.

Minimize total lifecycle cost.

- Single component
- Depend on a single team for specific pieces
- Standardize on a set of technologies, languages, and frameworks
- Have to be able to trust supplier of components

### 5 Improve constantly and forever the system of production and service, to improve quality and productivity, and thus constantly decrease costs.

- Do not focus on cost, focus on improving quality.
- focus on improving developer productivity, if they are more productive they can do more.

What improves developer productivity?

### 6 Institute training on the job.

### 7 Institute leadership (see Point 12 and Ch. 8 of Out of the Crisis). The aim of supervision should be to help people and machines and gadgets do a better job. Supervision of management is in need of overhaul, as well as supervision of production workers.

Is this relevant?

### 8 Drive out fear, so that everyone may work effectively for the company. (See Ch. 3 of Out of the Crisis)

No fault bugs, do not blame teams or individuals, place the blame on the process.

### 9 Break down barriers between departments. People in research, design, sales, and production must work as a team, to foresee problems of production and usage that may be encountered with the product or service.

Need all perspectives through all stages of the process. Make sure to have a good idea up front before building. Investigate as needed.

### 10 Eliminate slogans, exhortations, and targets for the work force asking for zero defects and new levels of productivity. Such exhortations only create adversarial relationships, as the bulk of the causes of low quality and low productivity belong to the system and thus lie beyond the power of the work force. (1) Eliminate work standards (quotas) on the factory floor. Substitute with leadership. (2) Eliminate management by objective. Eliminate management by numbers and numerical goals. Instead substitute with leadership.

"Zero Bug Bar" not realistic.

What does this say about telemetry? and Customer objectives? Qualitative over quantitative? What does this mean?

### 11 Remove barriers that rob the hourly worker of his right to pride of workmanship. The responsibility of supervisors must be changed from sheer numbers to quality.

It's not the number of tasks that are accomplished but the quality that a set of tasks were accomplied with.

### 12 Remove barriers that rob people in management and in engineering of their right to pride of workmanship. This means, inter alia, abolishment of the annual or merit rating and of management by objectives (See Ch. 3 of Out of the Crisis).

### 13 Institute a vigorous program of education and self-improvement.

### 14 Put everybody in the company to work to accomplish the transformation. The transformation is everybody's job.

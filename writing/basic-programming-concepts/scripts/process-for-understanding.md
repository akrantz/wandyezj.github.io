# Process for Understanding

Focus on using processes to understand.

Save improvement for "Process for improvement"

## Outline

1. Hook
    - "Processes surround us, shaping our modern world."
    - "From theater productions to farming, processes ~~improve~~ influence our lives."
    - "you too can harness the power of process to understand ~~, and improve~~ your every day life"

    - ~~"Thinking in terms of processes can help you understand and change our world."~~

1. Quote and Definition
    - "What is a process?"
    - "A process is a series of steps to bring about a result."

1. Give examples of processes
    - "For example, take your every day morning routine"
    - "What do you do each morning to prepare for your day ahead?"

    - "I usually wake up, exercise, take a shower, dress, and eat breakfast"

    - "Now that's an abstraction of my morning routine, many details are missing."

    - "wake"
    - "eat"
    - "clean"
    - "dress"
    - lego sets
    - assembly line
    - theaters

1. Refine

    - "In order to better understand a process it can be helpful to write down high level steps and the fill in the details."

    - Write Down the Steps
        - wake
        - shower
        - dress
        - eat
    
    - "Once we have the outline we can zoom in: asking and answering more specific question about each step and the transitions between them"

    "For example: What time do I wake up? What do I eat for breakfast? Do I do anything while I eat? How long does the morning routine take? Is the routine the same every day?"

    "By asking, and answering ever more specific question and writing those answers down we can obtain a better picture of any process."
    
1. Tell them what you told them

1. Introduce School Bus Example
    - introduce getting ready for the day, improve the process
    - What is the end?

1. Think more critically about the example
    - what is the purpose of the school bus?
    - Take students to and from school safely, save parents time having to rive to school to drop off and pick up their kids

1. Verbally describe the school bus

1. Explain why verbal is often insufficient
    - can't manipulate it

1. Write down the example
    - allows manipulation and mass distribution
    - pictures

1. Ask questions
    - missing steps
    - more detailed steps

1. End with a question
 "go forth and examine things more closely"


## Scratch

"A process is a series of steps to bring about a result."


Must be written down to understand and manipulate it.
Verbally describing a process to someone 


What you can understand you can manipulate

Taking the school bus to school example


Make the example more specific


Process is how knowledge is transmitted


You now have the tools to tackle real life processes.

# Ridiculous Party Platform

I've joked for a long time about a 'ridiculous' party that would advocate for boring common sense priorities and policies. This is an attempt to write down what those priorities and policies could be.

The central tenet of the ridiculous party platform is accountability. In our society it's important that we are all held accountable to each other and most importantly of all that our public institutions are held accountable to those they serve.

## Priorities

### Protect

We live in a rapidly changing world and face more threats than ever before, yet our defenses are geared toward old foes and insufficient to address emerging threats.

Internet

The Internet has never been a more dangerous place. Companies face daily growing threats from advanced actors. Critical infrastructure is increasingly taking advantage of the internet to deliver better services and this infrastructure must be continually secured to ensure its availability.

Internet freedoms are also under siege, we must ensure that access is always available to all citizens, that trusted information is made available and that censorship is minimized so that all citizens always have access to accurate information and are free to exercise their freedoms of speech and assembly.

Environment

The environment is an increasing threat to society and measures must be taken to secure human life and prosperity from natural disasters. Governments must take a deep look to help ensure that our cities are planned and homes and buisnesses built to resist natural disasters. In an increasingly physically connected society Pandemics are an threat and we must do more to ensure our society is prepared to prevent and quickly contain diseases.

## Invest

### Safety

### People

Individuals are the source of all our prosperity, by investing in individuals we can unlock a new wave of prosperity.

Education is no longer simply K12 it is life long. New tools and techniques are invented every day that can help people be safer and more pro

### Communities

- build strong and safe communities

### Buisnesses

- make it easier for individuals to start small buinesses
- simplify regulatory compliance for small buisnesses
- unfair to compete with buisnesses in other countries that do not hold their business to the same standards we will equalize the playing field.
- brief public reports on how each business is contributing to our communities well being.

### Government

- make government more efficient to spend hard earned tax dollars more wisely
- make government spending transparent so that every citizen can track where their tax dollars are spent
- annual readable reports on what government agencies have done to make our society a better place for everyone to live.

Sarcasm "Amazons careful selection"

How I became a published author"


Works with library checkout, libraries can reserve digital copies and have them checked out via Amazon Kindle.

Complexity of building an integrated platform is not to be underestimated. Many other competitors, but how do they make money?

Conveniently all in one place.

LitRPG genera, essentially DnD fanfiction.

Can read mobi file on the Kindle reader, can download from Open Library but this is less convenient than getting them from Amazon for the same title

Amazon KDP feedback


I love that I can easily put my work out there.


Tax information and royalties are annoying for students and non profits.


I'm interested in making my work easily accessible. 

I'd love an option to collect zero royalties, and sell at the minimum cost for Amazon to distribute the works.

I'd also find it convenient if I didn't have to set up any tax information up front but could simply distribute the work and have Amazon collect any royalties until I decide to pay out (like Patreon).

This would be particularly helpful for students and non profits who are more interested in putting their work out for publication than profits. 



kpf proprietary format does not convert to open formats like ebook

word and distribute pdf

have to promote the book anyway

tries to make money off of authors

terrible platform

amazon select really bad option

amazon charges money to give your own book away

learned how great microsoft word is
- export as pdf
- export as html

relationship between the company the customer on the business side, not a good partner

Amazon became the new middle man, in it's quest to cut out the middle man, distributor of content

but you can already distribute your content

Quest to divide and wall off the internet

incredibly cheap to distribute the work, azure websites cost less then a penny per month

amazon rebundling existing open source works freely available on Open Library and selling them

amazon "customer obsessed" but it sure doesn't feel like it

Patreon, all trying to be middle men, some ways convenient
distribute your own work then it cant be censored

When publishing a proof copy they change shipping and handling

so while the proof copy was 2.15 the shipping and handleing was 3.59 plus .58 cents of tax

despite me having Amazon Prime Bullshit!
Total for one copy is 6.32


If I ordered 2 copies the price for shipping jumped to 4.18

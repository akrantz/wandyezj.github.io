# Force Guidelines

Thinking about the use of force by police and concluding harmful philosophy is the root cause.

Where to have accountability?

People follow federal elections but not as often local elections, maybe it makes sense to have more federal oversite of local authorities to make sure they are held accountable to national standards.

What is allowed in Official Capacity.

Turn fines and jail time into community service hours.
fine / minimum wage = community service hours.
jail time = community service hours

a fine could be used to pay for educational programs, but want to remove the incentive that its profitable to punish people

bail is dumb get rid of it

jail is only for people who are flight risks or people who represent a persistent danger to the community

if someone moves then their community service hours transfer to their new community

charities and community organization can post how many volunteer hours they

fair for all socioeconomic levels

# Securing The Net - Securing Our Digital and Physical World

Society is rapidly fulfilling Weiser's vision of ubiquitous computing [Weiser 1991](). Computers are increasingly becoming embedded into everyday devices. Many of these devices are increasingly connected devices. These connected devices further blur the lines between the digital and physical world.

Connected devices offer many advantages to companies including:

- increased compliance
- preventative maintenance
- tracking
- product insights
- usability

and many other features that promise significant societal benefits.


With these increased benefits come increased risks that connected devices present to security and privacy. Risks to security and privacy can quickly turn into legal, brand, and financial liabilities.

Connected devices are subject to new forms of abuse in terms of both physical and digital attacks.

- Fraud
- Spyware
- Botnets
- Destruction


Legal - negligence
GDPR

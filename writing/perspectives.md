# Perspectives

Centralized Control is Centralized Failure.


Works _Out of Crisis_, _Kaizen_, _The Design of Everyday Things_, _Diffusion of Innovations_, _The Leader's Guide to Standards_, _McKeachie's Teaching Tips_

Each of these works is obsessed with management of process. Transfer of authority from individuals to process.

Perspective is increasing being applied as a dressed up word for opinion.

Not all opinions are valuable and not all opinions are useful in every situation. Some opinions actively contribute to achieving the opposite of the proposed desired outcome.

Many opinions are the result of fundamental differences in understanding of concepts. For example a common misunderstanding in math is the order of operations when students rely on PEMDAS acronym, many students apply multiplication before division and addition before subtraction, instead of weighing MD and AS  operations equally and evaluating them from left to right per convention. A key missing comprehension is that Addition and Subtraction (subtraction is the addition of a negative) are the same operation as are Multiplication and Division (division is the multiplication of a fraction). To be fair the mathematical standard conventions are arbitrary as are the symbols in most other languages. What makes the language usable as a from of communication is the standard understanding of the symbols.

Standards, reliability, comprehension, and coherence trump innovation.

Want people to come to a discussion equipped with the same set of perspectives regarding different issues. Values are always in conflict, need a prioritization of what matters.

Want to empower people with the tools they need to make informed decisions based on established criteria without relying on a central authority.


The point of publishing out specific details is to show that things are complicated and when someone with a lot of experience says something they probably have a good justification. The point of writing it up is so that justification can be pointed to and read by all. As more discussion of that justification happens then that explanation can be revisited and explored further.


Documentation is a necessary component but is not sufficient in itself.

Process Obsessed to achieve repeatable results at a designated quality.

It takes consistent effort to have people think about the whole instead of the individual pieces.

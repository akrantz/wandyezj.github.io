# Universal Document

A Universal Document is optimized to create, tell, and explore stories.

## State

The current state is that multiple applications are used to create, tell, and explore stories, text documents, numerical analysis documents, and presentation documents.

## Target

Why not have a single universal document that can be used to create, tell, and explore stories?


## Proposal

Documents are composed of multiple components:

- Tables
- Charts
- Text
- Images
- Video
- Visuals
- Code
- Sequences

The general format for creating a story is to:

- write up the exploration
- analyze sources and data
- put the analysis together
- create a presentation of some format

What do the interactions look like?

Can components link to components in other documents?

### Component Model

Some components stand alone, other components depend on other components as sources of data. For example a Chart could depend on a Table and as the table changes the Chart changes. In this aspect a document is potentially fluid as the data backing the document changes.

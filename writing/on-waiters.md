I like the restaurants in Portland where they have streamlined the restaurant experience by eliminating servers, requiring a paid order before taking a seat, having cups and a cooler of water for people to serve themselves, and having people take their dirty dishes to a bin before departing. Portland is leagues ahead in delicious food and efficient restaurant service (no sales tax also helps). Think about it, do you really need someone to take your order, bring your food to you, serve you water, or take away your plate when you're done? I think we should change the law to require that: 1) businesses can't screw their workers out of minimum wage (no exceptions) and 2) businesses can't use tips to pay for minimum wage (*cough* Amazon *cough*). These small changes will help speed the demise of the waiter profession, by increasing the business cost of waiters, thus encouraging their elimination from the floor of the most restaurants. Think of how much less expensive (or how much more profitable) restaurants could be if the waiter in the middle were eliminated. Being a waiter is also a physically strenuous (up on your feet for hours), sometimes emotionally challenging (customers can be jerks), and thankless job (how often have you thanked your waiter?). Additionally, having people wait on other people propagates the idea and practice of a classed society ,and encourages dependence instead of encouraging an independent do it yourself attitude. Eliminating waiters would be a boon to society and can't come soon enough.

# Designing a Disaster Preparedness Organization

## Objectives

The objectives of the organization are to prepare and respond to disasters, in order to protect society, life, and property.

Disasters {tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, storms, earthquakes, fires, volcanoes, famine, disease, oil spills, terrorism, etc...} require a coordinated response to mitigate potential damage. Failure to prepare for disaster can carry significant consequences for society.

Historically, across societies the inability of a government to adequately handle disasters undermines governments legitimacy. In contrast a competent response to disaster often increases a governments legitimacy.

Potential preparedness can include:

- Disaster Assessment
    - Understanding what disasters are likely in an area, both from areas historical precedent and from precedent in similar environments.
- Building Codes
    - Designing physical structures to mitigate potential damages
    - Require buildings adhere to specific standards to mitigate potential damage. {Zoning ordnances for flood plains or fire zones, Fire prevention codes, tornado and hurricane requirements for roofs and safe rooms}
- Societal Norms
    - Building societal norms and habits to mitigate potential disaster
- Stockpiling necessary supplies
    - Shelter, Food, Medicine
- Emergency Response Coordination
    - Building the necessary plans and networks to be activated in response to disaster.
- Training
    - Training of people in necessary skills for

## Difference in approach for National and State organizations

Federal organizations are best suited to gather experience across states and develop standard best practices for other states to learn from. Federal organizations are best equipped to coordinate responses to large scale events across states.

Federal organizations can also train emergency response teams for use across states and provide timely additional resources to take care of disasters quickly.

State organizations are best equipped to respond the disasters in their area. Most disasters should rely on state authority to mitigate them as they are closest to the ground.

The role of the federal organization is to provide support to state organizations for preparedness and provide the level of support requested to states as needed. In the case disasters cross state boundaries or are beyond state responsibilities and resources to handle, the federal organization should take charge.


## Departments

Suggested Functional departments

- Leadership
    - Leadership team, makes sure that all functions are held accountable.
- Codes
    - In charge of policy and building codes.
- Communication
    - In charge of all communication lines for all disasters. In charge of ensuring that communication lines are kept open and the right people are contacted for each response.
- Inventory
    - Manages all disaster preparedness inventory.
- Personal
    - Manages all personal. Including different response teams that can be dispatched to deal with disasters.
- Training
    - Produces training materials for all equipment, trains personal.
- Response
    - Keeps track of current disasters, prioritizes, and coordinates responses. Each disaster should have a single case manager (ideally pulled from the appropriate disaster team) to coordinate the response.
- Assessment
    - Assesses the effectiveness of preparation and responses efforts, finds gaps in the process, and ensures improvement recommendations are collected, and implemented.
- Information
    - Maintains information databases about all locations, property, people in potential disaster zones.

Each disaster type should have a corresponding department focused on mitigation (preparedness and response) of the specific disaster type. Most personal should freely float between departments as they are needed, and to ensure cross functional training. Each department needs to actively exercise both it's preparation and response at all times to maintain a constant state of vigilance and readiness to respond.

### Files

Increasingly files are being shared between different storage solutions. Data remains in transition between remote and local storage.

- External Drives
- Cloud Providers
- Local Storage

File types are also multiplying with different rules as to how the documents are modified. Modification can be broken into Static and Dynamic versioning schemes.

Static versioning fully replace the entire contents on each update, two changes completely overwrite each other. Dynamic versioning merges modifications to the same file with rules determining the revision order.

It would be convenient to have a single API that can modify files across many providers, considering each provider its one resource but still allowing access.

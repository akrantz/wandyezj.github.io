# Popular Culture

What is popular culture?

Culture shared among many people.

Media contains many messages. Often generalizations or tropes that suggest a certain way of viewing things.

Often the following seem to be emphasized:

- Fashion
- Wealth
- Fame
- Celebrities
- Sports

Why is leading a good humble life rarely emphasized in popular media?

The exciting seems to be emphasized more than the boring. Exciting is sophisticated, boring is crude. We appear to  desire everything to be extraordinary rather than ordinary.

Media is full of extraordinary, although most live ordinary lives.

Perhaps the culture of seeking the best brings out the best in us? Encourages us to be discontent with the current quo and to seek a better one.

Yet there is a difference between play and reality. Yet, aren't we all pretenders at some point? At what point does a role change?

What feeds the drive for extraordinary? Competition with neighbors? Feeding a sense of self superiority?

What if the emphasis were on cooperation?

Do we glorify competition over cooperation? Perhaps there is an inherent need to associate things with a human face. However, most great progress has been made with contributions by multiple people. Each of us every day  contributes to our cultural current. Yet, competing as teams of cooperative individuals is the new norm. Competition can challenge us to do our best for each other.

The cult of the individual and the cult of the collective are both misguided. The collective is a sum of individual efforts. Most great human projects have required multiple people to contribute in their own way. It important to recognize individuals contributions while realizing those contributions were possible by building on the work of others and often with support of others.

The work of a scientist to make new discoveries is aided by the farmers who produce their food, businesses that produce necessary supplies, and engineers who design the tools and machines needed to make research possible.

## Story Games

In some ways Story Games encapsulate many aspects of human relationships.

Each relationship can be thought of as its own game with constantly shifting rules as each person in the relationship changes and as the context changes.

The question becomes what kind of relationship do the people want to have?

Story Games attempt to set up a context to create a specific type of relationship between people.

Communicate in terms of future state.

primary message - conclusion + declarations
secondary message - supports + validates the conclusion


Prioritization of messages

Experience Arc, how to put the messages in order

conclusion up front, then justification

putting justifications up front has the audience start to form their own conclusions as they go along.

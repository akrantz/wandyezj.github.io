Purpose driven and creating value

Vision - transformation of belief and feeling
a set of ideas that describes a future state
the outcome of the mission

Theme as a short memorable phrase

Alignment - unite and guide your audience

Draw a picture of the vision



What is between you and achieving the vision?

What are the problems today and what are they stopping us from achieving?

Communicate in terms of future state.


Mission - what is the strategy, why an organization exists, what it's overall goal is
Vision - the result of what we are doing, objectives, road map

primary message - conclusion + declarations
secondary message - supports + validates the conclusion


Prioritization of messages

Experience Arc, how to put the messages in order

Be clear on what the conclusions are

conclusion up front, then justification

putting justifications up front has the audience start to form their own conclusions as they go along.

Have audience focus on the big ideas

Use secondary ideas to engage with them

Having someone challenge you means that they are engaged

Experience Arc

"Experience drives feelings.
"Belief drives behavior. Emotion drives belief."

Drama: move from conflict to resolution

Focus on the main message, redirect "red herrings" come back to it later, authority of the audience, where is the value to the audience.


- Speak, don't write
    - How you speak is different from how you right
- Conversational Tone
- Engage the sense
    - talk in terms of picture and sound "snaps the laptop closed and walks away"
- Clear and direct
- Be unpredictable
- Be bold


Media

"are your slides working for you or are you working for your slides?"

- Add to experience
- aspire to be art
- rule of thirds
- make headers conclusions
- enhance and support not repeat

Rehearsal Focus

- internalize content and structure
- nonlinear expression
    - rehearse out of order
    - do it backwards
- conversation and recitation
- audience engagement and focus
    - having a contestation with multiple people at once
- pushing boundaries
    - confidence, pause and speak slowly, emotional response
    - find a boundary and push it as you practice

"pausing creates negative space around big ideas"
"this is important verses This . . . . . is Important"

metronome to internalize time

- Pause
- Purpose
- Present
- Focus


- Grab & Go - pause look at notes, read what needed then continue
- Balanced Stance - feet apart hands in front
- Walk Talk Park - use sides of the room to represent different ideas
- Share the Love -  give attention to whole audience

Conclusion Driven

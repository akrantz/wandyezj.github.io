# Rhetorical Devices

Alliteration – Repetition of the initial consonant sounds beginning several words in sequence. (wild and woolly, threatening throngs) 

Anaphora – The repetition of a word or phrase at the beginning of successive clauses. (we cannot dedicate—we cannot consecrate—we cannot hallow—this ground) 

Asyndeton – Lack of conjunctions between coordinate phrases, clauses, or words. (I came. I saw. I conquered.) 

Epistrophe - Repetition of a word or expression at the end of successive phrases, clauses, sentences, or verses especially for rhetorical or poetic effect. (of the people, by the people, for the people) 

Euphemism – Substitution of an agreeable or at least non-offensive expression for one whose plainer meaning might be harsh or unpleasant. (re-orged) 

Hyperbole – Exaggeration for emphasis or for rhetorical effect. (mile-high ice-cream cones) 

Irony – Expression of something which is contrary to the intended meaning; the words say one thing but mean another. (the cobbler's children have no shoes) 

Metaphor – Implied comparison achieved through a figurative use of words; the word is used not in its literal sense, but in one analogous to it. (drowning in money) 

Onomatopoeia - The naming of a thing or action by a vocal imitation of the sound associated with it. (buzz, zap, knock) 

Oxymoron - A combination of contradictory or incongruous words. (cruel kindness) 

Paradox – An assertion seemingly opposed to common sense, but that may yet have some truth in it. (“What a pity that youth must be wasted on the young.”) 

Personification – Attribution of personality to an impersonal thing. (the wind whistles) 

Pleonasm – Use of superfluous or redundant words, often enriching the thought. (I saw it with my own eyes) 

Polysyndeton -- The use of a conjunction between each word, phrase, or clause--structurally the opposite of asyndeton. (I wore a sweater, and a hat, and a scarf, and a pair of boots)  

Simile – A comparison between two things using “like” or “as.” (cheeks like roses)

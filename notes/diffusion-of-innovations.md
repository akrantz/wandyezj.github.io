# Diffusion of Innovations

The Diffusion Of Innovations Fifth Edition by Everett M. Rogers


_diffusion_ is the process by which (1) an _innovation_ is (2) _communicated_ through certain _channels_ (3) _over time_ (4) among members of a _social system_.

- innovation
    - idea, practice, object, change
- communication channels
- time
- social system

## Innovation

Technology
    - hardware aspect, tool
    - software aspect, practices

Questions an individual asks about an innovation:

- What is the innovation?
- How does it work?
- Why does it work?
- What are the innovations consequences?
- What will be its advantages and disadvantages be in my situation?

Technology Cluster

- package of innovations that are adopted at once
- innovations are often interrelated and depend upon each other



Perceived Attributes of Innovations (adoption rate model)

- Relative Advantage
    - The degree to which an innovation is perceived as better than the idea it supersedes: {economic, prestige, convenience, satisfaction}. The more perceived advantage the greater the adoption rate.
- Compatibility
    - The degree to which an innovation is perceived as being consistent with existing {needs, values, experience} of potential adopters. Ideas that are incompatible with values and norms of a social system will have slower adoption. The adoption of an innovation incompatible with values and norms often requires adoption of a new value system (cultural change is slow).
- Complexity
    - The degree to which an innovation is perceived as difficult to understand and use. Ideas that are simpler to understand are adopted faster than those that require developing new skills and understanding.
- Trialability
    - The degree to which an innovation may be experimented on a limited basis. Ideas that can be tried on a limited basis presents less uncertainty when considering it for adoption, as it can be learned by doing.
- Observability
    - The degree to which the results of an innovation are visible to others. The easier it is to see positive results the more likely others will adopt.  

Relative Advantage and Compatibility are the most important for initial adoption. Complexity, Trialability, and observability control spread of an innovation from the initial group.


Reinvention - degree to which an innovation is change or modified by a user in the process of adoption and implementation.

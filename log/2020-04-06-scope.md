# 2020-04-06 Scope

A telescope allows us to zoom in on a piece of scenery to examine it in detail, or zoom out for a wider view. Zooming in and out may help connect a narrow view to a wider scene.

Scope may also be used to focus. One telescope can point to the mountains and another can point to the lake. By focusing views the mountain and the lake may be isolated from each other.

Everyone has their own telescope through which they view the world.

Orienting everyone's telescope to view the same scene may be key to effective communication.

Providing a common view may provide a starting point to reach a common understanding.

The concept of scope, or defining what is in view, is widely applicable to: context, objectives, responsibilities, and hierarchies.

Perhaps, an interesting application of scope is words in language which can take on different meanings depending on the broader view.

Surrounding culture, topic, and inflection may provide alternative  views that may change the meaning of a words.

An interesting example may be reading books. Authors when writing their works are embedded in a historical context. It may be difficult to appreciate the authors viewpoint without a broader understanding of the scope in which they are writing. Often writers are responding to current events, past events, or their contemporaries viewpoints with the assumption that the reader is familiar with the context. Words may also differ in meaning as language evolves and changes. A colloquial term may have different past meaning and intent then its modern usage. This can complicate fully appreciating an authors viewpoint. Similarly when take out of context, possibly when applying a modern one an authors viewpoint can seem quite strange or obsolete.

Keeping scope in mind may help us better understand and appreciate each others views.
